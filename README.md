In this project, we created a simple website that combines a 3D model as a teaser with regular HTML content.


The model itself is a laptop that when we scroll down it opens and displays the HTML content from a previous dummy website. We can even click and select content from it.

A small easter egg is hidden in the navigation bar links. Look for it!
