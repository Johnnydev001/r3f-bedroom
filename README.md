# r3f-electronics-store
In this project, we created a small example where we have a regular navigation bar together with a 3D model as the teaser in an e-commerce website. 
The model itself is a Macbook laptop, that when we scroll down, it opens and the HTML content from a previous example is displayed as a regular website. We can even click and select content from it.
A small easter egg is hidden in the navigation bar links. Look for it!
